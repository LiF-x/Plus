	Craft item effect id range: CraftItemEffectsManager::init (RVA 0x4DA990) only accepts <effect id> 1..38 from data/item_effects.xml
	(`cmp ecx,25h` on id-1 at RVA 0x4DAC33 and `cmp dil,26h` on the byte index at RVA 0x4DAC3F); anything above is dropped with
	"bad item effect id". The DB `effects` table itself is loaded into a byte-keyed std::map (CmMixingManager), so it has no such limit.
	This hook raises both immediates in memory (never on disk) to accept ids 1..127.
